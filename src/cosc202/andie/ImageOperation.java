 * Interface for operations to be applied to images.

 * 
 * <p>
 * Classes implementing ImageOperation represent operations that can be applied to images.
 * Each operation takes an image as input and provides an updated image as output.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A distinction should be made between an ImageOperation and an {@link ImageAction}.
 * An ImageOperation is applied to an image in order to change it in some way.
 * An ImageAction provides support for the user doing something to an image in the user interface.
 * ImageActions may apply an ImageOperation, but do not have to do so.
