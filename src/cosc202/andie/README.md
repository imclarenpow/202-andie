# ANDIE - A Non-Destructive Image Editor

ANDIE is a fast, lightweight and reliable editor for making basic image modifications

> ANDIE is still in development, so new features are still being added and bugs are still being resolved!

It is also non-destructive, in the sense that it can save an image, a set of image operations and edited version of the image separately

Examples of ANDIE can be seen below
