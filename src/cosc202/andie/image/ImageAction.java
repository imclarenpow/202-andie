/**
 * <p>
 * Abstract class representing actions the user might take in the interface.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This class uses Java's AbstractAction approach for Actions that can be applied to images.
 * The key difference from a generic AbstractAction is that an ImageAction contains a reference
 * to an image (via an ImagePanel interface element).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A distinction should be made between an ImageAction and an {@link ImageOperation}.
 * An ImageOperation is applied to an image in order to change it in some way.
 * An ImageAction provides support for the user doing something to an image in the user interface.
 * ImageActions may apply an ImageOperation, but do not have to do so.
